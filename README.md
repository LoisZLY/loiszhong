# Iceland Aurora Animation

This project visualizes simulated aurora intensity data for Iceland over the past week using a dreamy, aurora-inspired animation. The visualization features:

- Dynamic aurora wave curves with multi-layer cold color gradients
- Aurora band fill with soft gradient and light effects
- Flickering star-shaped data points along the curve
- Realistic meteor streaks across a fantasy blue-purple starry background
- All effects are implemented using pure Python and tkinter (no third-party dependencies)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (tkinter is included by default).
2. Download `iceland_aurora_animation.py` to your local machine.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python3 iceland_aurora_animation.py
```
